Breakout-Raunaq's Version
Created on June 23 2013

The basics and the logic behind it were adapted from Stanford's CS106A course. The url is here:http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111

The audioclip of the bouncing noise is also all part of the starter package which was downloaded from the website above.

Some ideas were also taken from the handout given on that website for breakout but were coded by me

The background music is royalty free from the website: http://teknoaxe.com/cgi-bin/home.pl

Song Name-Eight Bit Rockin' Village Loop
Artist: TeknoAXE (http://www.youtube.com/user/teknoaxe/featured)



Have fun! It's a lot more difficult than it looks!
